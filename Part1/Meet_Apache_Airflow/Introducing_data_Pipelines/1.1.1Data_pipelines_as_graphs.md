One way to make dependencies between tasks more explicit is to draw the data pipeline as a graph. In this graph-based representation, tasks are represented as nodes in the graph, 
while dependencies between tasks are represented by directed edges between the task nodes. The direction of the edge indicates the direction of the dependency, 
with an edge pointing from task A to task B, indicating that task A needs to be completed before task B can start. Note that this type of graph is generally called a directed graph, 
due to the directions in the graph edges.
 
Applying this graph representation to our weather dashboard pipeline, we can see that the graph provides a relatively intuitive representation of the overall pipeline (figure 1.2).
By just quickly glancing at the graph, we can see that our pipeline consists of three different tasks, each corresponding to one of the tasks outlined. 
Other than this, the direction of the edges clearly indicates the order in which the tasks need to be executed: we can simply follow the arrows to trace the execution.

This type of graph is typically called a directed acyclic graph (DAG), as the graph contains directed edges and does not contain any loops or cycles (acyclic). 
This acyclic property is extremely important, as it prevents us from running into circular dependencies(figure 1.3) between tasks (where task A depends on task B and vice versa). 
These circular dependencies become problematic when trying to execute the graph, as we run into a situation where task 2 can only execute once task 3 has been completed, 
while task 3 can only execute once task 2 has been completed. This logical inconsistency leads to a deadlock type of situation, in which neither task 2 nor 3 can run, 
preventing us from executing the graph.

Note that this representation is different from cyclic graph representations, which can contain cycles to illustrate iterative parts of algorithms (for example), as are common
in many machine learning applications. However, the acyclic property of DAGs is used by Airflow (and many other workflow managers) to efficiently resolve and execute these
graphs of tasks.
