One way to make dependencies between tasks more explicit is to draw the data pipeline as a graph. In this graph-based representation, tasks are represented as nodes in the graph, 
while dependencies between tasks are represented by directed edges between the task nodes. The direction of the edge indicates the direction of the dependency, 
with an edge pointing from task A to task B, indicating that task A needs to be completed before task B can start. Note that this type of graph is generally called a directed graph, 
due to the directions in the graph edges.
 
Applying this graph representation to our weather dashboard pipeline, we can see that the graph provides a relatively intuitive representation of the overall pipeline (figure 1.2).
By just quickly glancing at the graph, we can see that our pipeline consists of three different tasks, each corresponding to one of the tasks outlined. 
Other than this, the direction of the edges clearly indicates the order in which the tasks need to be executed: we can simply follow the arrows to trace the execution.

This type of graph is typically called a directed acyclic graph (DAG), as the graph contains directed edges and does not contain any loops or cycles (acyclic). 
This acyclic property is extremely important, as it prevents us from running into circular dependencies(figure 1.3) between tasks (where task A depends on task B and vice versa). 
These circular dependencies become problematic when trying to execute the graph, as we run into a situation where task 2 can only execute once task 3 has been completed, 
while task 3 can only execute once task 2 has been completed. This logical inconsistency leads to a deadlock type of situation, in which neither task 2 nor 3 can run, 
preventing us from executing the graph.

Note that this representation is different from cyclic graph representations, which can contain cycles to illustrate iterative parts of algorithms (for example), as are common
in many machine learning applications. However, the acyclic property of DAGs is used by Airflow (and many other workflow managers) to efficiently resolve and execute these
graphs of tasks.

一个让任务之间的依赖性更加清晰的办法是把数据管道画出来。在这个图表中，任务是图里的节点，节点间的有向线代表了任务间的依赖性。线的方向代表了依赖性的方向，A任务到B任务的线代表着A得先完成，B才能开始。因此这种图叫方向图。

把这种方法应用到我们的天气图表管道中，我们可以看到图1.2展现了整个管道。很快浏览一下，我们可以看到有三个任务，同时，线的方向也很清晰的展示了任务的执行顺序，我们可以简单遵循箭头来执行操作。

这种图表叫有向无环图，因为包括了有向线和没有任何环。没有任何环很重要，因为这避免了进入圈状循环，像是图中一样。这种圈状的循环会在执行时产生问题。就像图中如任务2依赖于任务3执行完才能执行，任务3却又依赖于任务2执行完才能执行。这种逻辑的不自洽就会导致死锁，任务2或者3都无法执行。

值得注意的是，这种有环图在大部分机器学习应用中却很常见，用来表示算法里的循环迭代。然而，AirFlow中运用的是有向无环图，用来执行任务。
